AB  - Bacterial infections have always been an unrestrained challenge to the medical 
      community due to the rise of multi-drug tolerant and resistant strains. Pioneering 
      work on Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase (PPK) by Arthur Kornberg has generated 
      great interest in this polyphosphate (PolyP) synthesizing enzyme. PPK has wide 
      distribution among pathogens and is involved in promoting pathogenesis, stress 
      management and susceptibility to antibiotics. Further, the absence of a PPK 
      orthologue in humans makes it a potential drug target. This review covers the 
      functional and structural aspects of polyphosphate kinases in bacterial pathogens. A 
      description of molecules being designed against PPKs has been provided, challenges 
      associated with PPK inhibitor design are highlighted and the strategies to enable 
      development of efficient drug against this enzyme have also been discussed.
