abstract = {Cervical cancer is a major cause of gynecological related mortalities in developing countries. Cisplatin, a potent chemotherapeutic agent used for treating advanced cervical cancer exhibits side effects and resistance development. The current study was aimed to investigate the repurposing of l-menthol as a potential therapeutic drug against cervical cancer. L-menthol was predicted to be non-toxic with good pharmacokinetic properties based on SwissADME and pkCSM analysis. Subsequently, 543 and 1664 targets of l-menthol and cervical cancer were identified using STITCH, BATMAN-TCM, PharmMapper and CTD databases. STRING and Cytoscape analysis of the merged proteinâ€“protein interaction network revealed 107 core targets of l- menthol against cervical cancer. M-CODE identified highly connected clusters between the core targets which through KEGG analysis were found to be enriched in pathways related to apoptosis and adherence junctions. Molecular docking showed that l- menthol targeted E6, E6AP and E7 onco-proteins of HPV that interact and inactivate TP53 and Rb1 in cervical cancer, respectively. Molecular docking also showed good binding affinity of l-menthol toward proteins associated with apoptosis and migration. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed stability of the docked complexes. In vitro analysis confirmed that l-menthol was cytotoxic towards cervical cancer CaSki cells and altered expression of TP53, Rb1, CDKN1A, E2F1, NFKB1, Akt-1, caspase-3, CDH1 and MMP-2 genes identified through network pharmacology approach.
