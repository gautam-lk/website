	abstract = {Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a debilitating, progressive lung disease with few therapeutic options, largely due to a paucity of mechanistic knowledge of disease pathogenesis. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are known to envelope and invade clusters of LAM-cells, comprising of smooth muscle α-actin and/or HMB-45 positive "smooth muscle-like cells{\textquotedblright} however the role of LECs in LAM pathogenesis is still unknown. To address this critical knowledge gap, we investigated wether LECs interact with LAM-cells to augment their metastatic behaviour of LAM-cells. We performed in situ spatialomics and identified a core of transcriptomically related cells within the LAM nodules. Pathway analysis highlights wound and pulmonary healing, VEGF signaling, extracellular matrix/actin cytoskeletal regulating and the HOTAIR regulatory pathway enriched in the LAM Core cells. We developed an organoid co-culture model combining primary LAM-cells with LECs and applied this to evaluate invasion, migration, and the impact of Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor. LAM-LEC organoids had significantly higher extracellular matrix invasion, decreased solidity and a greater perimeter, reflecting increased invasion compared to non-LAM control smooth muscle cells. Sorafenib significantly inhibited this invasion in both LAM spheroids and LAM-LEC organoids compared to their respective controls. We identified TGFβ1ι1, a molecular adapter coordinating protein-protein interactions at the focal adhesion complex and known to regulate VEGF, TGFβ and Wnt signalling, as a Sorafenib-regulated kinase in LAM-cells. In conclusion we have developed a novel 3D co-culture LAM model and have demonstrated the effectiveness of Sorafenib to inhibit LAM-cell invasion, identifying new avenues for therapeutic intervention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
