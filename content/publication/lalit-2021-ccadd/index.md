<p style="text-align:justify;"> abstract: BACKGROUND- <i>Xenorhabdus nematophila</i> maintains species-specific mutual interaction with nematodes of <i>Steinernema</i> genus. Type II Toxin Antitoxin (TA) systems, the mazEF TA system controls stress and programmed cell death in bacteria. OBJECTIVE- This study elucidates the functional characterization of Xn-mazEF, a mazEF homolog in <i>X. nematophila</i> by computational and <i>in vitro</i> approaches. METHODS- 3D-structural models for Xn-MazE toxin and Xn-MazF antitoxin were generated, validated and characterized for protein-RNA interaction analysis. Further biological and cellular functions of Xn-MazF toxin were also predicted. Molecular dynamics simulations of 50ns for Xn- MazF toxin complexed with nucleic acid units (DU, RU, RC, and RU) were performed. The MazF toxin and complete MazEF operon were endogenously expressed and monitored for the killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> host cells under arabinose induced tightly regulated system. RESULTS- Upon induction, <i>E. coli</i> expressing toxin showed rapid killing within four hours and attained up to 65% growth inhibition, while the expression of the entire operon did not show significant killing. The observation suggests that the Xn-mazEF TA system control transcriptional regulation in <i>X. nematophila</i> and helps to manage stress or cause toxicity leading to programmed death of cells. CONCLUSION- The study provides insights into structural and functional features of novel toxin, Xn- MazF and provides an initial inference on control of <i>X. nematophila</i> growth regulated by TA systems.</p>
