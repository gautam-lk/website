abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen known for high morbidity and mortality. It causes life-threatening infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia, meningitis, wound and urinary tract infections (UTI). Increase in carbapenem resistance exhibited by A. baumannii has accentuated the need for novel targets for effective treatment. Despite the pronounced relevance of PPK2 as a pathogenicity determinant in several pathogens, it has not been explored as a drug target in A. baumannii. The present study was piloted to investigate the substrate binding by A. baumannii PPK2 (AbPPK2), a two-domain Class II polyphosphate kinase 2. A homology model of AbPPK2 was developed and validated for molecular docking of ATP and ADP in the predicted binding pocket. Further analysis of AbPPK2 revealed a set of common residues in the catalytic cleft interacting with ATP and ADP which would be useful for the screening of inhibitors against A. baumannii.}
