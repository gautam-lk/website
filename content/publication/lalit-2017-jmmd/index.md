abstract: <p style="text-align:justify;">Toxin-antitoxin (TA) complexes play an important role in stress responses and programmed cell death in bacteria. The RelB-RelE toxin antitoxin system is well studied in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In this study, we used combined <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> approaches to study a novel Xn-RelT toxin from <i>Xenorhabdus nematophila</i> bearing its own antitoxin Xn-RelAT - a RelB homolog of <i>E. coli</i>. The structure for this toxin-antitoxin pair is yet unknown. We generated homology-based models of <i>X. nematophila</i> RelT toxin and antitoxin. The deduced models were further characterized for protein-nucleic acid, protein-protein interactions and gene ontology. A detrimental effect of recombinant Xn-RelT on host <i>E. coli</i> was determined through endogenous toxicity assay. When expressed from a isopropyl <i>Î²</i>-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside-regulated LacZ promoter, Xn-RelT toxin showed a toxic effect on <i>E. coli</i> cells. These observations imply that the conditional cooperativity governing the Xn-RelT TA operon in <i>X. nematophila</i> plays an important role in stress management and programmed cell death.</p>
