AB  - BACKGROUND: Xenorhabdus nematophila maintains species-specific mutual interaction 
      with nematodes of Steinernema genus. Type II Toxin Antitoxin (TA) systems, the mazEF 
      TA system controls stress and programmed cell death in bacteria. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study elucidates the functional characterization of Xn-mazEF, a mazEF homolog in X. 
      nematophila by computational and in vitro approaches. METHODS: 3D- structural models 
      for Xn-MazE toxin and Xn-MazF antitoxin were generated, validated and characterized 
      for protein - RNA interaction analysis. Further biological and cellular functions of 
      Xn-MazF toxin were also predicted. Molecular dynamics simulations of 50ns for Xn- 
      MazF toxin complexed with nucleic acid units (DU, RU, RC, and RU) were performed. 
      The MazF toxin and complete MazEF operon were endogenously expressed and monitored 
      for the killing of Escherichia coli host cells under arabinose induced tightly 
      regulated system. RESULTS: Upon induction, E. coli expressing toxin showed rapid 
      killing within four hours and attained up to 65% growth inhibition, while the 
      expression of the entire operon did not show significant killing. The observation 
      suggests that the Xn-mazEF TA system control transcriptional regulation in X. 
      nematophila and helps to manage stress or cause toxicity leading to programmed death 
      of cells. CONCLUSION: The study provides insights into structural and functional 
      features of novel toxin, Xn- MazF and provides an initial inference on control of X. 
      nematophila growth regulated by TA systems.
