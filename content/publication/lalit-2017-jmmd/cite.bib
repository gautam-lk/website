AB  - Toxin-antitoxin (TA) complexes play an important role in stress responses and 
      programmed cell death in bacteria. The RelB-RelE toxin antitoxin system is well 
      studied in Escherichia coli. In this study, we used combined in silico and in vitro 
      approaches to study a novel Xn-RelT toxin from Xenorhabdus nematophila bearing its 
      own antitoxin Xn-RelAT-a RelB homolog of E. coli. The structure for this 
      toxin-antitoxin pair is yet unknown. We generated homology-based models of X. 
      nematophila RelT toxin and antitoxin. The deduced models were further characterized 
      for protein-nucleic acid, protein-protein interactions and gene ontology. A 
      detrimental effect of recombinant Xn-RelT on host E. coli was determined through 
      endogenous toxicity assay. When expressed from a isopropyl 
      Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside-regulated LacZ promoter, Xn-RelT toxin showed a toxic 
      effect on E. coli cells. These observations imply that the conditional cooperativity 
      governing the Xn-RelT TA operon in X. nematophila plays an important role in stress 
      management and programmed cell death.
