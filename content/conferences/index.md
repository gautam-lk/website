    This 10-course online specialization comprised of two specializations of 5-course each, namely Data Science: Foundations using R and Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning covered the foundational concepts and tools for the data science pipeline including how to use the tools of the trade (The Data Scientist’s Toolbox) think analytically about complex problems (R Programming), manage large data sets (Getting and Cleaning Data), create visualizations (Exploratory Data Analysis), and publish reproducible analyses (Reproducible Research) This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.
